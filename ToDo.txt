pdf2 word:
    If you add a pdf with a space in, it adds "\\/" after "C:"
    "(C:\\//Users/peter/Desktop/Hen%20ning.pdf)"
    pretty weird, need fixing! 
    the problem is fixed but now it saves at one level lower

GUI:
    "filedisplay" is djanky to far in the rigth side

pyinstaller:
            pyinstaller.exe --onefile interface.py --hiddenimport windnd


Over_All:
        maybe add a fileloop that disable "word" button if a "pdf" file is added to the list
        and disable "pdf" button if a "docx" file is added
